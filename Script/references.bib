abstract = {The remarkable growth of wireless data traffic in recent times has driven the need to explore suitable regions in the radio spectrum to meet the projected requirements. In pursuance of this, millimeter wave communications have received considerable attention in the research fraternity. Due to the high path and penetration losses at millimeter wavelengths, antenna beamforming assumes a pivotal role in establishing and maintaining a robust communication link. Beamforming for millimeter wave communications poses a multitude of diverse challenges due to the large channel bandwidth, unique channel characteristics, and hardware constraints. In this paper, we track the evolution and advancements in antenna beamforming for millimeter wave communications in the context of the distinct requirements for indoor and outdoor communication scenarios. We expand the scope of discussion by including the developments in radio frequency system design and implementation for millimeter wave beamforming. We explore the suitability of millimeter wave beamforming methods, both, existing and proposed till midyear 2015, and identify the exciting new prospects unfolding in this domain.},

As the exhaustive search is time consuming, hierarchical search has been widely accepted to reduce the complexity, and its performance is highly dependent on the codebook design. In this paper, we propose two basic criteria for the hierarchical codebook design, and devise an efficient hierarchical codebook by jointly exploiting sub-array and deactivation (turning-off) antenna processing techniques, where closed-form expressions are provided to generate the codebook. Performance evaluations are conducted under different system and channel models. Results show superiority of the proposed codebook over the existing alternatives.},

abstract = {Hybrid multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems consist of an analog beamformer with large antenna arrays followed by a digital MIMO processor. Channel estimation for hybrid MIMO systems in millimeter wave (mm-wave) communications is challenging because of the large antenna array and the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) before beamforming. In this paper, we propose an open-loop channel estimator for mm-wave hybrid MIMO systems exploiting the sparse nature of mm-wave channels. A sparse signal recovery problem is formulated for channel estimation and solved by the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) based methods. A modification of the OMP algorithm, called the multi-grid (MG) OMP, is proposed. It is shown that the MG-OMP can significantly reduce the computational load of the OMP method. A process for designing the training beams is also developed. Specifically, given the analog training beams the baseband processor for beam training is designed. Simulation results demonstrate the advantage of the OMP based methods over the conventional least squares (LS) method and the efficiency of the MG-OMP over the original OMP.},

abstract = {Communication at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies is defining a new era of wireless communication. The mmWave band offers higher bandwidth communication channels versus those presently used in commercial wireless systems. The applications of mmWave are immense: wireless local and personal area networks in the unlicensed band, 5G cellular systems, not to mention vehicular area networks, ad hoc networks, and wearables. Signal processing is critical for enabling the next generation of mmWave communication. Due to the use of large antenna arrays at the transmitter and receiver, combined with radio frequency and mixed signal power constraints, new multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication signal processing techniques are needed. Because of the wide bandwidths, low complexity transceiver algorithms become important. There are opportunities to exploit techniques like compressed sensing for channel estimation and beamforming. This article provides an overview of signal processing challenges in mmWave wireless systems, with an emphasis on those faced by using MIMO communication at higher carrier frequencies.},

The operations of differentiation and filtering are especially important both as an end in themselves, and as a prelude to further treatment of the data. Numerical counterparts of analog devices that perform these operations, such as RC filters, are often considered. However, the method of least squares may be used without additional computational complexity and with considerable improvement in the information obtained. The least squares calculations may be carried out in the computer by convolution of the data points with properly chosen sets of integers. These sets of integers and their normalizing factors are described and their use is illustrated in spectroscopic applications. The computer programs required are relatively simple.

Reflections from walls and buildings and penetration losses were measured for indoor and outdoor materials, such as tinted glass, clear glass, brick, concrete, and drywall at 28 GHz in New York City. A 400 Mega-chip-per-second sliding correlator channel sounder and 24.5 dBi steerable horn antennas were used to emulate future mobile devices with adaptive antennas that will likely be used in future millimeter wave cellular systems [1]. Measurements in and around buildings show that outdoor building materials are excellent reflectors with the largest measured reflection coefficient of 0.896 for tinted glass as compared to indoor building materials that are less reflective. We also found that penetration loss is dependent not only on the number of obstructions and distance between transmitter and receiver, but also on the surrounding environment. The greatest penetration loss containing three interior walls of an office building was found to be 45.1 dB, with 11.39 m separation between the transmitter and receiver. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

These characteristics of mmWave communications pose several challenges to fully exploit the potential of mmWave communications, including integrated circuits and system design, interference management, spatial reuse, anti-blockage, and dynamics control. To address these challenges, we carry out a survey of existing solutions and standards, and propose design guidelines in architectures and protocols for mmWave communications. We also discuss the potential applications of mmWave communications in the 5G network, including the small cell access, the cellular access, and the wireless backhaul. Finally, we discuss relevant open research issues including the new physical layer technology, software-defined network architecture, measurements of network state information, efficient control mechanisms, and heterogeneous networking, which should be further investigated to facilitate the deployment of mmWave communication systems in the future 5G networks.},

abstract = {MmWave communication is very promising for the vehicular network, where high data rate for exchanging sensory data as well as high-quality entertainment video streaming is required. In mmWave vehicular networks, handover occurs more frequently due to the mobility of vehicles and the sensitivity of mmWave beams to the dynamic blockage and deafness. However, beam re-sweeping is required during the handover process, due to the directional beamforming adopted in mmWave vehicular networks, which is very time-consuming. Hence, in this paper, we propose a base stations (BSs) coordination based beam selection method to facilitate fast handover for the connected vehicles. We exploit the angle information extracted from the beam codewords of previous serving BS to refine the beam searching space of targeting BS, which possesses low complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed method can significantly reduce the size of beam searching space of target BS.},

abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient-based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

However, due to mobility and other imperfections in the estimation process, the spatial information obtained at the base station (BS) and the user (UE) is likely to be noisy, degrading beam alignment performance. In this paper, we introduce a robust beam alignment framework in order to exhibit resilience with respect to this problem. We first recast beam alignment as a decentralized coordination problem where BS and UE seek coordination on the basis of correlated yet individual position information. We formulate the optimum beam alignment solution as the solution of a Bayesian team decision problem. We then propose a suite of algorithms to approach optimality with reduced complexity. The effectiveness of the robust beam alignment procedure, compared with classical designs, is then verified on simulation settings with varying location information accuracies.},

abstract = {With the severe spectrum shortage in conventional cellular bands, millimeter wave (mmW) frequencies between 30 and 300 GHz have been attracting growing attention as a possible candidate for next-generation micro- and picocellular wireless networks. The mmW bands offer orders of magnitude greater spectrum than current cellular allocations and enable very high-dimensional antenna arrays for further gains via beamforming and spatial multiplexing. This paper uses recent real-world measurements at 28 and 73 GHz in New York, NY, USA, to derive detailed spatial statistical models of the channels and uses these models to provide a realistic assessment of mmW micro- and picocellular networks in a dense urban deployment. Statistical models are derived for key channel parameters, including the path loss, number of spatial clusters, angular dispersion, and outage. It is found that, even in highly non-line-of-sight environments, strong signals can be detected 100-200 m from potential cell sites, potentially with multiple clusters to support spatial multiplexing. Moreover, a system simulation based on the models predicts that mmW systems can offer an order of magnitude increase in capacity over current state-of-the-art 4G cellular networks with no increase in cell density from current urban deployments. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {- In order to realize high speed, long range, reliable transmission in millimeter-wave 60 GHz wireless personal area networks (60 GHz WPANs), we propose a beamforming (BF) protocol realized in media access control (MAC) layer on top of multiple physical layer (PHY) designs. The proposed BF protocol targets to minimize the BF set-up time and to mitigate the high path loss of 60 GHz WPAN systems. It consists of 3 stages, namely the device (DEV) to DEV linking, sector-level searching and beam-level searching. The division of the stages facilitates significant reduction in setup time as compared to BF protocols with exhaustive searching mechanisms. The proposed BF protocol employs discrete phase-shifters, which significantly simplifies the structure of DEVs as compared to the conventional BF with phase-and-amplitude adjustment, at the expense of a gain degradation of less than 1 dB. The proposed BF protocol is a complete design and PHY-independent, it is applicable to different antenna configurations. Simulation results show that the setup time of the proposed BF protocol is as small as 2{\%} when compared to the exhaustive searching protocol. Furthermore, based on the codebooks with four phases per element, around 15.1 dB gain is achieved by using eight antenna elements at both transmitter and receiver, thereby enabling 1.6 Gbps-data-streaming over a range of three meters. Due to the flexibility in supporting multiple PHY layer designs, the proposed protocol has been adopted by the IEEE 802.15.3c as an optional functionality to realize Gbps communication systems.},

abstract = {Millimeter wave (mm-wave) communication is expected to be widely deployed in fifth generation (5G) wireless networks due to the substantial bandwidth available for licensed and unlicensed use at mm-wave frequencies. To overcome the higher path loss observed at mm-wave bands, most prior work focused on the design of directional beamforming using analog and/or hybrid beamforming techniques in large-scale multiple-input multiple-output systems. Obtaining potential gains from highly directional beamforming in practical systems hinges on sufficient levels of channel estimation accuracy, where the problem of channel estimation becomes more challenging due to the substantial training overhead needed to sound all directions using a high-resolution narrow beam. In this paper, we consider the design of multi-resolution beamforming sequences to enable the system to quickly search out the dominant channel direction for single-path channels. The resulting design generates a multilevel beamforming sequence that strikes a balance between minimizing the training overhead and maximizing beamforming gain, where a subset of multilevel beamforming vectors is chosen adaptively to maximize the average data rate within a constrained time. We propose an efficient method to design a hierarchical multi-resolution codebook utilizing a Butler matrix, i.e., a generalized discrete Fourier transform matrix. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

abstract = {The increasing wireless data traffic demands have driven the need to explore suitable spectrum regions for meeting the projected requirements. In the light of this, millimeter wave (mmWave) communication has received considerable attention from the research community. Typically, in fifth generation (5G) wireless networks, mmWave massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications is realized by the hybrid transceivers which combine high dimensional analog phase shifters and power amplifiers with lower-dimensional digital signal processing units. This hybrid beamforming design reduces the cost and power consumption which is aligned with an energy-efficient design vision of 5G. In this paper, we track the progress in hybrid beamforming for massive MIMO communications in the context of system models of the hybrid transceivers' structures, the digital and analog beamforming matrices with the possible antenna configuration scenarios and the hybrid beamforming in heterogeneous wireless networks. We extend the scope of the discussion by including resource management issues in hybrid beamforming. We explore the suitability of hybrid beamforming methods, both, existing and proposed till first quarter of 2017, and identify the exciting future challenges in this domain.},

abstract = {Supporting high mobility in millimeter wave (mmWave) systems enables a wide range of important applications, such as vehicular communications and wireless virtual/augmented reality. Realizing this in practice, though, requires overcoming several challenges. First, the use of narrow beams and the sensitivity of mmWave signals to blockage greatly impact the coverage and reliability of highly-mobile links. Second, highly-mobile users in dense mmWave deployments need to frequently hand-off between base stations (BSs), which is associated with critical control and latency overhead. Furthermore, identifying the optimal beamforming vectors in large antenna array mmWave systems requires considerable training overhead, which significantly affects the efficiency of these mobile systems. In this paper, a novel integrated machine learning and coordinated beamforming solution is developed to overcome these challenges and enable highly-mobile mmWave applications. In the proposed solution, a number of distributed yet coordinating BSs simultaneously serve a mobile user. This user ideally needs to transmit only one uplink training pilot sequence that will be jointly received at the coordinating BSs using omni or quasi-omni beam patterns. These received signals draw a defining signature not only for the user location, but also for its interaction with the surrounding environment. The developed solution then leverages a deep learning model that learns how to use these signatures to predict the beamforming vectors at the BSs. This renders a comprehensive solution that supports highly mobile mmWave applications with reliable coverage, low latency, and negligible training overhead. Extensive simulation results based on accurate ray-tracing, show that the proposed deep-learning coordinated beamforming strategy approaches the achievable rate of the genie-aided solution that knows the optimal beamforming vectors with no training overhead. Compared with traditional beamforming solutions, the results show that the proposed deep learning-based strategy attains higher rates, especially in high-mobility large-array regimes.},

Enabling mmWave communications requires appropriate beamforming, which is conventionally realized by a lengthy beam training process. Such beam training will be a challenge for applying mmWave to mobile environments. As a solution, a beam tracking method requiring to train only one beam pair to track a path in the analog beamforming architecture is developed. Considering its low complexity which is suitable for mobile settings, the extended Kalman filter is chosen as the tracking filter. Several effects impacting the performance of the proposed tracking algorithm, such as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and array size, are investigated. It is found that at the same SNR, narrower beams, which are more sensitive to angular changes, can provide more accurate estimate. Too narrow beams, however, degrade tracking performance because beam misalignment could happen during the measurement. Finally, a comparison to prior work is given where it is shown that our approach is more suitable for fast-changing environments thanks to the low measurement overhead.},

Assuming a fully digital architecture at sub-6 GHz; and an analog architecture at mmWave, we outline a strategy to extract spatial information from sub-6 GHz and its use in mmWave compressed beam-selection. Specifically, we formulate compressed beam-selection as a weighted sparse signal recovery problem, and obtain the weighting information from sub-6 GHz channels. In addition, we outline a structured precoder/combiner design to tailor the training to out-of-band information. We also extend the proposed out-of-band aided compressed beam-selection approach to leverage information from all active subcarriers at mmWave. To simulate multi-band frequency dependent channels, we review the prior work on frequency dependent channel behavior and outline a multi-frequency channel model.

This is mainly thanks to their powerful capabilities in learning unknown models and tackling hard optimization problems. To advance the machine learning research in mmWave/massive MIMO, however, there is a need for a common dataset. This dataset can be used to evaluate the developed algorithms, reproduce the results, set benchmarks, and compare the different solutions. In this work, we introduce the DeepMIMO dataset, which is a generic dataset for mmWave/massive MIMO channels. The DeepMIMO dataset generation framework has two important features. First, the DeepMIMO channels are constructed based on accurate ray-tracing data obtained from Remcom Wireless InSite. The DeepMIMO channels, therefore, capture the dependence on the environment geometry/materials and transmitter/receiver locations, which is essential for several machine learning applications. Second, the DeepMIMO dataset is generic/parameterized as the researcher can adjust a set of system and channel parameters to tailor the generated DeepMIMO dataset for the target machine learning application. The DeepMIMO dataset can then be completely defined by the (i) the adopted ray-tracing scenario and (ii) the set of parameters, which enables the accurate definition and reproduction of the dataset. In this paper, an example DeepMIMO dataset is described based on an outdoor ray-tracing scenario of 18 base stations and more than one million users. The paper also shows how this dataset can be used in an example deep learning application of mmWave beam prediction.},

abstract = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) has been claimed to be the only viable solution for high-bandwidth vehicular communications. However, frequent channel estimation and beamforming required to provide a satisfactory quality of service limits mmWave for vehicular communications. In this paper, we propose a novel channel estimation and beam tracking framework for mmWave communications in a vehicular network setting. For channel estimation, we propose an algorithm termed robust adaptive multi-feedback (RAF) that achieves comparable estimation performance as existing channel estimation algorithms, with a significantly smaller number of feedback bits. We derive upper and lower bounds on the probability of estimation error (PEE) of the RAF algorithm, given a number of channel estimations, whose accuracy is verified through Monte Carlo simulations. For beam tracking, we propose a new practical model for mmWave vehicular communications. In contrast to the prior works, the model is based on position, velocity, and channel coefficient, which allows a significant improvement of the tracking performance. Focused on the new beam tracking model, we re-derive the equations for Jacobian matrices, reducing the complexity for vehicular communications. An extensive number of simulations is conducted to show the superiority of our proposed channel estimation method and beam tracking algorithm in comparison with the existing algorithms and models. Our simulations suggest that the RAF algorithm can achieve the desired PEE, while on average, reducing the feedback overhead by 75.5{\%} and the total channel estimation time by 14{\%}. The beam tracking algorithm is also shown to significantly improve beam tracking performance, allowing more room for data transmission.},

abstract = {Multi-beam concurrent transmission is one of promising solutions for a millimeter-wave (mmWave) network to provide seamless handover, robustness to blockage, and continuous connectivity. Nevertheless, one of the major obstacles in multi-beam concurrent transmissions is the optimization of beam pair selection, which is essential to improve the mmWave network performance. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel heterogeneous multi-beam cloud radio access network (HMBCRAN) architecture which provides seamless mobility and coverage for mmWave networks. We also design a novel acquirement method for candidate beam pair links (BPLs) in HMBCRANs architecture, which reduces user power consumption, signaling overhead, and overall time consumption. Based on HMBCRANs architecture and the resulted candidate BPLs for each user equipment, a beam pair selection optimization problem aiming at maximizing network sum rate is formulated. To find the solution efficiently, the considered problem is reformulated as a non-operative game with local interaction, which only needs local information exchanging among players. A decentralized algorithm based on HMBCRANs architecture and binary log-linear learning is proposed to obtain the optimal pure strategy Nash equilibrium of the proposed game, in which a concurrent multi-player selection scheme and an information exchanging protocol among players are developed to reduce the complexity and signal overheads. The stability, optimality, and complexity of the proposed algorithm are analyzed via theoretical and simulation method. The results prove that the proposed scheme has better convergence speed and sum rate against the state-of-the-art schemes.},

abstract = {Efficient beam alignment is a crucial component in millimeter wave systems with analog beamforming, especially in fast-changing vehicular settings. This paper proposes to use the vehicle's position (e.g., available via GPS) to query a multipath fingerprint database, which provides prior knowledge of potential pointing directions for reliable beam alignment. The approach is the inverse of fingerprinting localization, where the measured multipath signature is compared to the fingerprint database to retrieve the most likely position. The power loss probability is introduced as a metric to quantify misalignment accuracy and is used for optimizing candidate beam selection. Two candidate beam selection methods are developed, where one is a heuristic while the other minimizes the misalignment probability. The proposed beam alignment is evaluated using realistic channels generated from a commercial ray-tracing simulator. Using the generated channels, an extensive investigation is provided, which includes the required measurement sample size to build an effective fingerprint, the impact of measurement noise, the sensitivity to changes in traffic density, and beam alignment overhead comparison with IEEE 802.11ad as the baseline. Using the concept of beam coherence time, which is the duration between two consecutive beam alignments, and parameters of IEEE 802.11ad, the overhead is compared in the mobility context. The results show that while the proposed approach provides increasing rates with larger antenna arrays, IEEE 802.11ad has decreasing rates due to the higher beam training overhead that eats up a large portion of the beam coherence time, which becomes shorter with increasing mobility.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new beam allocation strategy aiming to maximize the average successful tracking probability (ASTP) of a single user time-varying millimeter-wave MIMO system. In contrast to most existing works that employ one transmitting-receiving (Tx-Rx) beam pair once only, we investigate a more general framework, where the Tx-Rx beam pairs are allowed to be used repeatedly in each beam training period to improve the received signal powers in specific directions. In the case of orthogonal Tx-Rx beam pairs, a power-based estimator is employed to track the time-varying AoA and AoD of the channel, and the resulting training beam pair sequence design problem is formulated as an integer nonlinear programming (I-NLP) problem. By dividing the feasible region into a set of subregions, the formulated I-NLP is decomposed into a series of concave sub I-NLPs, which can be solved by recursively invoking a nonlinear branch-and-bound algorithm. To reduce the computational cost, we relax the integer constraints of each sub I-NLP and obtain a low-complexity solution via solving the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of their relaxed problems. For the case when the Tx-Rx beam pairs are overlapped in the angular space, we estimate the updated AoA and AoD via an orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm. Moreover, since no explicit expression for the ASTP exists for the OMP-based estimator, we derive a closed-form lower bound of the ASTP, based on which a favorable beam pair allocation strategy can be obtained. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed beam allocation strategy over existing benchmarks.},

abstract = {In this article, we suggest an efficient beam switching technique for the emerging 60GHz wireless personal area networks. Given the pre-specified beam codebooks, the beam switching process, aiming to identify the best beam-pair for data transmissions, is formulated as a global optimization problem in a two-dimension plane that is formed by the potential beam pattern index. As the analytical gradient information of the objective reward function is practically unavailable, Rosenbrock numerical algorithm is properly adopted to implement beam searching, by implicitly approaching and exploiting the gradient descent direction through the numerical pattern-search mechanic. In order to enhance search performance, furthermore, a novel initialization process is presented to provide the feasible initial solution for Rosenbrock search. Inspired by the appealing conception of small-region dividing and conquering, this pre-search algorithm can efficiently reduce the search scope and hence improve the success probability. The developed beam switching technique, i.e. an initialization process followed by Rosenbrock search, exhibits a much lower complexity than the current state-of-the-art strategies. It is demonstrated from both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments that, compared with the existing popular methods, the required protocol overhead of the new beam-training procedure can be significantly reduced, accompanying the power consumption of 60GHz devices. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {With the increasing demand of ultra-high-speed wireless communications and the existing low frequency band (e.g., sub-6GHz) becomes more and more crowded, millimeter-wave (mmWave) with large spectra available is considered as the most promising frequency band for future wireless communications. Since the mmWave suffers a serious path-loss, beam-forming techniques shall be adopted to concentrate the transmit power and receive region on a narrow beam for achieving long distance communications. However, the mobility of users will bring frequent beam handoff, which will decrease the quality of experience (QoE). Therefore, efficient beam tracking mechanism should be carefully researched. However, the existing beam tracking mechanisms concentrate on system throughput maximization without considering beam handoff and link robustness. This paper proposes a throughput and robustness guaranteed beam tracking mechanism for mobile mmWave communication systems which takes account of both system throughput and handoff probability. Simulation results show that the proposed throughput and robustness guaranteed beam tracking mechanism can provide better performance than the other beam tracking mechanisms.},

abstract = {The millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies offer the availability of huge bandwidths to provide unprecedented data rates to next-generation cellular mobile terminals. However, mmWave links are highly susceptible to rapid channel variations and suffer from severe free-space pathloss and atmospheric absorption. To address these challenges, the base stations and the mobile terminals will use highly directional antennas to achieve sufficient link budget in wide area networks. The consequence is the need for precise alignment of the transmitter and the receiver beams, an operation which may increase the latency of establishing a link, and has important implications for control layer procedures, such as initial access, handover and beam tracking. This tutorial provides an overview of recently proposed measurement techniques for beam and mobility management in mmWave cellular networks, and gives insights into the design of accurate, reactive and robust control schemes suitable for a 3GPP NR cellular network. We will illustrate that the best strategy depends on the specific environment in which the nodes are deployed, and give guidelines to inform the optimal choice as a function of the system parameters.},

abstract = {Millimeter wave provides a promising approach for meeting the ever-growing traffic demand in next generation wireless networks. It is crucial to obtain the channel state information in order to perform beamforming and combining to compensate for severe path loss in this band. In contrast to lower frequencies, a typical millimeter wave channel consists of a few dominant paths. Thus it is generally sufficient to estimate the path gains, angles of departure (AoDs), and angles of arrival (AoAs) of those paths. Proposed in this paper is a dual timescale model to characterize abrupt channel changes (e.g., blockage) and slow variations of AoDs and AoAs. This work focuses on tracking the slow variations and detecting abrupt changes. A Kalman filter based tracking algorithm and an abrupt change detection method are proposed. The tracking algorithm is compared with the adaptive algorithm due to Alkhateeb, Ayach, Leus and Heath (2014) in the case with a single radio frequency chain. Simulation results show that to achieve the same tracking performance, the proposed algorithm requires much lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and much fewer pilots than the other algorithm. Moreover, the change detection method can always detect abrupt changes with moderate number of pilots and SNR.},

In this paper, we focus on omnidirectional beamforming for common signal transmission in a massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system equipped with a uniform rectangular array (URA). We first model the omnidirectional transmission as a feasibility optimization problem in a matrix form. By counting the number of equality constraints and the degrees of freedom of the matrix variable, we conjecture that it takes at least three beamforming vectors to achieve constant-power signal transmission at any direction for a URA with more than two rows/columns. We then propose an efficient iterative rank-reduction algorithm, which can obtain three beamforming vectors that can generate a perfectly flat radiation beampattern, but cannot reduce further for a URA with more than two rows/columns. That is, the algorithm numerically verifies the conjecture. The numerical results validate the superior performance of the proposed scheme over the existing alternatives.},

In a vehicular mmWave system, beam tracking is a challenging task due to the user's fast mobility and narrow beam of mmWave transmission. In this paper, we study the intelligent beam tracking scheme with low training overhead for mmWave vehicular transmission. Specifically, we utilize the past channel state information (CSI) to efficiently predict the future channel by designing a machine learning prediction model. Using such predicted CSI, the base stations (BSs) reduce the number of channel estimations and save the overhead of pilots. We build the prediction model based on a long short term memory (LSTM) structure whose dataset is composed of the channel vectors of each coherence time duration. The experiments show that the proposed LSTM can accurately predict the channel of the vehicular user and achieve satisfactory transmission rate with less pilot overhead than that of traditional beam training scheme.},

It is considered as a key technology for fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks and is already used in wireless LAN (e.g., IEEE 802.11ad). Using mmWave for vehicular communications, however, is often viewed with some skepticism due to a misconception that the Doppler spread would become too large at these high frequencies. This is not necessarily true when directional beams are employed. In this paper, closed-form expressions relating the channel coherence time and beamwidth are derived. Unlike prior work that assumed perfect beam pointing, the pointing error due to the receiver motion is incorporated to show that there exists a nonzero optimal beamwidth that maximizes the coherence time. We define a novel concept of beam coherence time, which is an effective measure of beam alignment frequency. Using the derived correlation function, the channel coherence time, and the beam coherence time, an overall performance metric considering both the channel time variation and the beam alignment overhead is derived. Using this metric, it is shown that beam realignment in every beam coherence time performs better than beam realignment in every channel coherence time.},

Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) can provide efficient real-time information exchange among vehicles without the need of pervasive roadside communication infrastructure. Although mobile cellular networks are capable of providing wide coverage for vehicular users, the requirements of services that require stringent real-time safety cannot always be guaranteed by cellular networks. Therefore, the Heterogeneous Vehicular NETwork (HetVNET), which integrates cellular networks with DSRC, is a potential solution for meeting the communication requirements of the ITS. Although there are a plethora of reported studies on either DSRC or cellular networks, joint research of these two areas is still at its infancy. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on recent wireless networks techniques applied to HetVNETs. Firstly, the requirements and use cases of safety and non-safety services are summarized and compared. Consequently, a HetVNET framework that utilizes a variety of wireless networking techniques is presented, followed by the descriptions of various applications for some typical scenarios. Building such HetVNETs requires a deep understanding of heterogeneity and its associated challenges. Thus, major challenges and solutions that are related to both the Medium Access Control (MAC) and network layers in HetVNETs are studied and discussed in detail. Finally, we outline open issues that help to identify new research directions in HetVNETs.},

Nevertheless, the directionality of mmWave communications and its susceptibility to blockage raise severe questions on the feasibility of mmWave vehicular communications. The dynamic nature of 5G vehicular scenarios, and the complexity of directional mmWave communication calls for higher context-awareness and adaptability. To this aim, we propose the first online learning algorithm addressing the problem of beam selection with environment-awareness in mmWave vehicular systems. In particular, we model this problem as a contextual multi-armed bandit problem. Next, we propose a lightweight context-aware online learning algorithm, namely FML, with proven performance bound and guaranteed convergence. FML exploits coarse user location information and aggregates received data to learn from and adapt to its environment. We also perform an extensive evaluation using realistic traffic patterns derived from Google Maps. Our evaluation shows that FML enables mmWave base stations to achieve near-optimal performance on average within 33 minutes of deployment by learning from the available context. Moreover, FML remains within 5{\%} of the optimal performance by swift adaptation to system changes such as blockage and traffic.},
